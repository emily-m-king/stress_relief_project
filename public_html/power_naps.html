<h1>Through Power Naps</h1>
<p>Naps are essential in relieving stress, especially if you are someone with a busy schedule. Power naps allow your body and brain to process and recover all the information absorbed throughout the time you were awake. Naps help to increase one's alertness, thinking, and performance.</p>
<h2>Ways to Prepare for Your Powered Naps &colon;</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Start off by arranging the place you want to rest your body, comfy and relaxing. This can be done by making your bed or whatever surface you choose to lay down your body on. Have the room you are going to rest in be scented with a nice relaxing scent to help you feel relaxed.</li>
		<li>Set a timer and put on relaxing soft background noise like rainfall or soothing piano noise to help calm your mind and body.</li>
		<li>Taking a minimum of 30 to 90 minutes of a nap throughout the day will get you the boost of energy needed to keep you moving and relieve the tension in your body and a load of emotions stored throughout.</li>
