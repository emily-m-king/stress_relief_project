<h1>About Page</h1> 
<h2>Unwinding from Stress&colon;</h2>
<p>Our organization name is Unwind from Stress which was established in 2021 by Delefine and Luwam, who are current Simpson College students. This organization provides services to people of all backgrounds and needs. Services provided consist of information to help people become aware of the stressors in their life and resources to help mitigate them. We are located in Houston Texas on 50th street of University avenue and our office hours are from 12pm till 7:30pm.</p>
<h2>Purpose&colon;</h2>
<p>The purpose of our organization is to help give individuals the resources and tools necessary to cope with stressors that are a result of school, work, and/or other personal and life matters. Exercising for many has been utilized as a way to help reduce stress and to promote a long and healthy lifestyle. There are numerous ways one can exercise that does not require intense force or energy. One does not necessarily need to be athletic or physically fit to partake in exercise activities that are beneficial in ways of reducing stress through a boost of endorphins. Endorphins are hormones that have effects on your brain in ways of reducing pain and increasing feelings of happiness. Some ways that our organization promotes and assists our clients with distress is through guided walks, dance, and yoga exercises that are led by professionals.</p>
