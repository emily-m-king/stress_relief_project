		<td>Daily or weekly timed walks are beneficial in assisting to relieve stress. Walking with your back straight and letting your arms naturally swing as you walk are some ways to ensure that you allow your body to distress. Over time, one can increase their distance of walking or work on increasing the speed of their walk.</td>
		<td>yoga is a form of relaxation that helps to calm the body, mind, and control breathing. This form of exercising is peaceful when performed in a space that is free of distractions. You can choose to position yourself in any way that suits your comfort. Set a timer for each position and  work through taking deep breaths in and out.</td>
